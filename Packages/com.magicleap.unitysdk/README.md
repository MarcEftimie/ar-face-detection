# Magic Leap Unity SDK
This is the official Magic Leap Unity SDK, which exposes the full Magic Leap device capabilities within the Unity engine. 

Scoped Registry URL: `http://registry.npmjs.org`

Scope: com.magicleap

This SDK is provided in the form of an npm-style Unity Package. Therefore, integration into your Unity project is as easy as [adding our scoped registry to your project settings](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-PackageManager.html) and using the Unity Package Manager to install. After installation, upgrades and dependencies can also be managed via the Unity Package Manager. 

For a full list of features and documentation on how to use the Magic Leap Unity SDK, see [this page on the Magic Leap Developer Portal](https://developer-docs.magicleap.cloud/docs/guides/unity/getting-started/unity-getting-started).

Examples can be found at our [Example Project page](https://github.com/magicleap/MagicLeapUnityExamples).

Note : If this package depends on unreleased versions of the Magic Leap XR Plugin (com.unity.xr.magicleap), that plugin will need to be added to the project manually.

Note : Preview builds will not be uploaded on npm. The package will need to either be embedded in the project, or linked locally using the download path.
