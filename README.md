# Magic Leap Unity Examples

## Overview
This project is meant to provide the Magic Leap Unity SDK and examples and has been configured to help the user quickly jump in start developing for the Lumin platform, whether it is via the Magic Leap App Simulator tool or deploying the app directly to the device.

The files in this project can change or even be removed from one release to another. If you're planning on depending or modifying these assets for your own project, we recommend that you duplicate the files, change the names and move them out of the Assets/MagicLeap folder. This will avoid issues like your changes being deleted when you upgrade to a new unitypackage.
